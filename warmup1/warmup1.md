    -   cloves garlic
    -   sweet potatoes
    -   celery root
    -   yukon gold
    -   heavy cream
    -   chicken or vegetable
    -   grated gruyere cheese
    -   minced fresh thyme leaves
    -   fresh breadcrumbs or panko
    -   butter
2.  **`special tools`**
    -   two pans
    -   baking dish
    -   oven
    -   two pans
    -   baking dish
    -   oven

steps
-----

1.  Heat your oven to 350°F. Butter a 13×9-inch deep baking dish. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large deep (ideally 12-inch) saute pan over medium heat and add the onions and fennel. Cooking, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more.
2.  Meanwhile, in the largest bowl you own, combine the onion mixture with remaining vegetables, cream, stock, cheese, thyme, 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper. Pour mixture into prepared dish and spread until even. Mix breadcrumbs and butter until evenly coated and distribute evenly over top of dish.
3.  Bake 1 1/2 hours uncovered, or until vegetables are very tender when tested with a small knife and the top is browned and bubbly. Allow to set for 15 minutes at room temperature and serve hot.

Euclidean Distance
==================

Visit the wikipedia page for the Euclidean Distance: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance>

### Definition

 The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\sqrt{pq}$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>)and q =(*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space,then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or *Euclidean length*, or *magnitude* of a vector measures the length of the vector:
∥**p**∥=$\\sqrt{p\_{1}^2+p\_{2}^2+...p\_{n}^2}=\\sqrt{\\textbf{p}·\\textbf{p}}$ where the last expression involves the dot product.
