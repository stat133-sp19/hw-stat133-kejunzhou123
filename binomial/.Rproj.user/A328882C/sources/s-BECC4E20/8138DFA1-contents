## Overview
`binomial` is a minimal package that provides functions to get the probability given trials, success time and provides the functions to get summary measures like mean, variance, etc. It also generates some plots to show the probability and cumulative probability.

## Installation
install the development version from Github via the 

```{r}
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 
# install "cointoss" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("kejunzhou123/binomial")
# install "cointoss" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("kejunzhou123/binomial", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


# Usage
```{r}
library(library)
# get the total combination number
bin_choose(5, 1:3)
#get the probability
s=bin_probability(5,trials = 10, prob = 0.5)
s
# get the distribution and plot the distribution
b=bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
b
plot(b)
# get the cumulative probabilities
a=bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
a
plot(a)

# get the variable and print the summary thing
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
bin1
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1

# get functions of measures
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)

```
