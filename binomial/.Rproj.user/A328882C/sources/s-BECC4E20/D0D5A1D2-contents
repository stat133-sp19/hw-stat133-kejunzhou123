## calculating binomial probabilities
The package `"binomial"` is about calculating the probabilities of the given binomial, getting summary of this binomial and get the visualization the related probabilities and the cumulative probabilities.

## get the number of combinations
The first step is to get the total combination number when you input two values. The first argument is n and the second argument is k. k can be a sequence.  
```{r}
bin_choose(5, 1:3)

```
## get the probability
You can get the probability by input three arguments. The first is success and the second is trails and the third is prob. The output will be the probability.
```{r}

s=bin_probability(5,trials = 10, prob = 0.5)
s

```

## get the distribution
You can get the probablity according to different success time. The output is a dataframe with two classes `"bindis"` and `"data.frame"`  
The `plot()` function give you the barplot using the data frame
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
b=bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
b
plot(b)

```
## get the cumulative 
you can get the cumulative probabilities. the output will be a dataframe with two classes "bincum" and "data.frame"

the `plot()` function will give you the cumulative probability's plot  
```{r}
#library(ggplot2)
a=bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
a
plot(a)
```
## get the variable
You can input the trials and the probability to check whether it is valid and it will return a class named "binvar"

the `print()` function will give you the content of the object
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
bin1
```
the `summary()` function will give you the full summary description of the object and the `print.summary()` function will give a nicely contents of the summary output
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```
## functions of measures
You can use different functions to get the mean, variance,mode,skewness and kurtosis.

```{r}
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
